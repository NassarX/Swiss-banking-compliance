TITLE: Crypto Assets and Virtual Currency Regulations - Swiss Compliance Framework

1. INTRODUCTION AND REGULATORY APPROACH

Switzerland has adopted a technology-neutral, principles-based approach to regulating crypto assets and virtual currencies. Rather than creating a specific cryptocurrency law, Switzerland applies existing financial market regulations according to the principle of "same business, same risks, same rules."

Key regulatory frameworks applicable to crypto assets include:
- Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA)
- Financial Services Act (FinSA)
- Financial Institutions Act (FinIA)
- Banking Act (BankA)
- Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FinMIA)
- Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA)

2. TYPES OF CRYPTO ASSETS AND CLASSIFICATION

2.1 Token Classification
- Payment tokens (cryptocurrencies)
- Utility tokens
- Asset tokens (security tokens)
- Hybrid tokens

EXAMPLE:
Classification assessment process:
- Analyze token's economic function and purpose
- Review white paper and technical documentation
- Assess rights conveyed to token holders
- Determine applicable regulatory framework based on classification
- Document classification analysis and rationale
- Monitor for changes that might affect classification

2.2 Regulatory Implications of Classification
- Payment tokens: Subject to AMLA, potentially BankA
- Utility tokens: May be exempt if purely for access purposes
- Asset tokens: Subject to securities regulation (FinSA/FinMIA)
- Hybrid tokens: Subject to multiple regulatory frameworks

EXAMPLE:
Regulatory determination for security token:
- Classify token as asset token based on investment characteristics
