TITLE: FINMA Circular 2016/7 - Video and Online Identification - Digital Onboarding Guide

1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

FINMA Circular 2016/7 establishes requirements for financial intermediaries to perform digital customer identification through:
- Video identification (real-time audiovisual communication)
- Online identification (non-video digital verification methods)

This circular enables regulatory-compliant remote onboarding while maintaining due diligence standards.

2. VIDEO IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1 Technical and Organizational Requirements
- Secure video transmission with appropriate quality
- Trained staff conducting verification
- Session recording and documentation

EXAMPLE:
Technical implementation requirements:
- End-to-end encrypted video connection
- Minimum resolution suitable for document verification
- Adequate lighting conditions for visual identification
- Recording capability for audit purposes
- Secure storage of verification recordings

2.2 Identity Verification Process
- Real-time interaction with verification questions
- Document authenticity verification
- Facial recognition comparison
- Risk indicator monitoring

EXAMPLE:
Standard video verification process:
1. Obtain client consent for recording
2. Request presentation of ID document
3. Verify security features (holograms, patterns)
4. Direct client to move ID to verify security elements
5. Compare face with ID photo with various angles
6. Ask verification questions from ID and other information
7. Document entire process with timestamps

2.3 High-Risk Situations
- Identification of risk indicators
- Enhanced verification procedures
- Abort conditions

EXAMPLE:
Risk indicators requiring additional measures:
- Poor video quality or lighting
- Suspicious client behavior (reading answers, looking off-camera)
- Document inconsistencies or damage
- Difficulty answering verification questions
- Documentation of risk assessment and additional steps taken

3. ONLINE IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Document Verification
- Digital submission of identification documents
- Verification of authenticity features
- Comparison with databases

EXAMPLE:
Online verification implementation:
- Secure document upload portal
- High-resolution image capture
- Automated security feature verification
- Cross-check against document databases (e.g., PRADO)
- Machine-readable zone (MRZ) validation

3.2 Verification Transaction
- Bank transfer from pre-existing account
- Verification of account ownership
- Transaction amount requirements

EXAMPLE:
Transaction verification process:
1. Client uploads identification documents
2. System performs initial verification
3. Client makes micro-transfer from personal bank account
4. System matches transfer details with provided identity
5. Both verification elements must align for approval

3.3 Digital Signature Requirements
- Qualified electronic signature standards
- Verification of signature validity
- Documentation requirements

EXAMPLE:
Digital signature implementation:
- Integration with qualified e-signature provider
- Identity verification before signature creation
- Validation of signature certificate
- Documentation of signature verification process

4. LIVENESS DETECTION

4.1 Anti-Fraud Measures
- Ensure real person is present
- Prevent use of photos or recordings
- Dynamic verification techniques

EXAMPLE:
Liveness detection methods:
- Random movement instructions during video call
- Unpredictable verification questions
- Biometric analysis of facial movements
- Challenge-response verification
- AI-based spoofing detection

5. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD KEEPING

5.1 Required Documentation
- Complete verification records
- Audit trail of verification steps
- Secure storage requirements

EXAMPLE:
Documentation requirements:
- Video recordings of verification sessions
- Timestamps of verification process steps
- Copies of identification documents submitted
- Results of document authenticity checks
- Verification transaction details (if applicable)
- Staff member conducting verification
- Risk assessment and decision documentation

6. IMPLEMENTATION MODELS

6.1 In-House Implementation
- Financial institution operates own verification system
- Direct staff training and supervision
- Internal control system

EXAMPLE:
In-house implementation requirements:
- Dedicated verification technology
- Staff training program
- Quality control procedures
- Regular compliance reviews
- Documentation of verification processes

6.2 Outsourcing to Service Provider
- Third-party verification services
- Oversight and control requirements
- Delegation agreement documentation

EXAMPLE:
Outsourcing implementation requirements:
- Formal delegation agreement
- Service provider due diligence
- Regular monitoring of service quality
- Clear responsibility allocation
- Contingency planning
