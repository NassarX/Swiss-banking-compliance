# COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO SWISS ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS AND DIRECTIVES

## I. INTRODUCTION TO THE SWISS AML FRAMEWORK

### A. Overview of Switzerland's Commitment to Combating ML/TF

Switzerland, as a prominent global financial center particularly renowned for cross-border wealth management, has established a robust framework to combat money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF). This commitment is essential for safeguarding the reputation of the Swiss financial center and aligns with international efforts to prevent the abuse of financial systems for illicit purposes.

The Swiss approach to AML/CFT is significantly influenced by international standards, primarily those set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). As an active FATF member, Switzerland rigorously implements its recommendations and undergoes periodic mutual evaluations. These evaluations, along with evolving global risks and high-profile international money laundering cases, have driven the continuous evolution and strengthening of the Swiss AML framework.

The regulatory landscape reflects a multi-pronged strategy, combining federal legislation, detailed ordinances issued by the Federal Council and FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority), and significant elements of industry self-regulation, most notably the Swiss Bankers Association's Code of Conduct. Switzerland also emphasizes international cooperation, sharing information with foreign counterparts through its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to combat transnational financial crime.

### B. Key Legislation and Regulations

The Swiss AML/CFT framework is built upon several key legal and regulatory instruments:

1. **Federal Act on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (AMLA - SR 955.0)**: The cornerstone of Swiss AML legislation enacted in 1997 and subsequently amended multiple times. It defines the primary obligations for combating ML and TF.

   - **Scope (Art. 2 AMLA)**: Applies broadly to "financial intermediaries" including banks, securities firms, fund management companies, asset managers, insurance institutions, casinos, portfolio managers, trustees, and those who professionally accept, hold, or assist in transferring assets belonging to others.

   - **Core Duties (Art. 3-10 AMLA)**:
     - Verification of the contracting party's identity (Art. 3)
     - Identification and verification of the beneficial owner's identity (Art. 4)
     - Duty to repeat identification/BO establishment if doubts arise (Art. 5)
     - Special duty to clarify unusual or high-risk transactions/relationships (Art. 6)
     - Duty to establish and maintain adequate records (Art. 7)
     - Duty to implement organizational measures, including controls and training (Art. 8)
     - Duty to report suspicions to the Money Laundering Reporting Office (MROS) (Art. 9)
     - Duty to freeze assets connected to a report (Art. 10)

2. **Ordinance on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (AMLO - SR 955.01)**: Issued by the Swiss Federal Council, providing further detail on AMLA implementation, clarifying requirements for self-regulatory organizations (SROs), and specifying due diligence and reporting obligations for dealers accepting large cash payments.

3. **FINMA Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO-FINMA - SR 955.033.0)**: Issued by FINMA for financial intermediaries under its direct supervision, specifying implementation of AMLA/AMLO obligations. It details requirements for risk management frameworks, organizational measures, transaction monitoring systems, and enhanced due diligence procedures.

4. **Swiss Bankers Association's Agreement on the Code of Conduct (CDB 20)**: While technically a self-regulatory agreement, it holds significant regulatory weight, recognized by FINMA and referenced in AMLO-FINMA. It provides practical instructions on customer identification and beneficial owner verification procedures.

5. **Other Relevant Legislation**:
   - Swiss Criminal Code (SCC - SR 311.0): Defines predicate offenses
   - Financial Market Supervision Act (FINMASA - SR 956.1)
   - Banking Act (BA - SR 952.0)
   - Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA - SR 951.31)
   - Financial Institutions Act (FinIA - SR 954.1)
   - Financial Services Act (FinSA - SR 950.1)

## II. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND SUPERVISION

The oversight of AML/CFT compliance in Switzerland is shared among several key bodies:

### A. Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA)

FINMA is the independent government body responsible for prudential supervision across a significant portion of the Swiss financial sector. Its mandate covers banks, securities firms, insurance companies, collective investment schemes, portfolio managers, trustees, and other financial institutions subject to specific licensing requirements.

FINMA employs various supervisory tools:
- Audits conducted by licensed audit firms
- Targeted on-site reviews and inspections
- Issuance of circulars clarifying interpretation of financial market laws
- Enforcement powers ranging from corrective measures to license withdrawal

Recent supervisory focus areas include:
- Adequacy of money laundering risk analyses
- Management of risks associated with complex client structures
- Effectiveness of transaction monitoring systems
- Due diligence applied to Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)
- Cross-border risks
- Virtual asset risks
- International sanctions compliance

### B. Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland (MROS)

MROS functions as Switzerland's central Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and is administratively part of the Federal Office of Police (fedpol). Its primary role is to receive, analyze, and process Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) submitted by financial intermediaries and dealers.

Upon receiving a SAR, MROS conducts analysis, potentially gathering additional information. If suspicion is substantiated, MROS forwards the case to competent prosecution authorities for investigation. MROS also:
- Exchanges information with domestic authorities and foreign FIUs
- Conducts strategic analysis of ML/TF trends
- Produces national risk assessments
- Disseminates findings to raise awareness
- Manages the 'goAML' secure electronic platform for SAR submissions

### C. Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) and Supervisory Organizations (SOs)

Switzerland employs a system of self-regulation alongside direct FINMA supervision:

- **SROs**: Certain financial intermediaries not directly supervised by FINMA must affiliate with an SRO recognized and supervised by FINMA. These SROs issue their own detailed AML regulations (meeting AMLO-FINMA minimum standards), monitor members' compliance, and impose sanctions for violations.

- **SOs**: Following legislative changes, independent portfolio managers and trustees are supervised by Supervisory Organizations authorized by FINMA, which monitor AML compliance and must involve FINMA in serious violation cases.

## III. CORE DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS

### A. Customer Identification and Verification (KYC/CDD)

The foundational duty is to know one's customer:

**Legal Requirement (AMLA Art. 3)**: Financial intermediaries must verify the identity of their contracting party when establishing a business relationship based on documents of evidentiary value. For legal entities, verification of signatory powers and the identity of natural persons acting on behalf of the entity is required.

**Practical Procedures (CDB 20 Art. 4-19)**:

- **Scope (Art. 4)**: Covers account openings, passbooks, securities accounts, safe-deposit boxes, fiduciary transactions, management agreements, and significant cash transactions (>CHF 15,000).

- **Information to Document (Art. 7)**: For natural persons: full name, DOB, nationality, domicile address, identification method. For legal entities: company name, registered office address, identification method.

- **Methods of Identification**:
  - Face-to-Face (Art. 9): Inspection of original official photo ID and retention of copy
  - Correspondence/Online (Art. 10): Authenticated copy of ID and address verification
  - Authentication Sources (Art. 11): Branches/group companies, correspondent banks, notaries/public bodies, electronic signature providers

- **Legal Entities (Art. 12-17)**: Verification via recent commercial register extract or equivalent. Unregistered entities use articles of association or similar documents.

- **Exceptions (Art. 18-19)**: For accounts opened for minors by identified adults, rental surety accounts, and identification within financial groups with equivalent standards.

### B. Beneficial Owner (BO) Identification and Verification

**Legal Requirement (AMLA Art. 4)**: Financial intermediaries must identify and verify the beneficial owner "with the due diligence required in the circumstances." Written declarations regarding BO identity are required when customers are not the BO, are domiciliary companies, or are operating legal entities.

**Practical Procedures (CDB 20 Art. 20-42 & Forms)**:

- **General Declaration (Form A)**: Required when a third party is the BO, documenting name, DOB, nationality, address or company details.

- **Controlling Person (Form K)**: For operating legal entities and partnerships, identifying controlling persons through a cascade approach:
  1. Natural persons holding ≥25% of capital/voting rights
  2. Natural persons exercising control through other means
  3. Senior management if no controllers identified

- **Beneficial Owner (Domiciliary Companies - Form A)**: Declares ultimate beneficial owner(s) of assets held by non-operating entities.

- **Verification Duty**: Added in 2023 AMLA revision, requires active assessment of declaration plausibility against other client information, public sources, and potentially additional documentation.

- **Specific Structures & Forms**:
  - Foundations (Form S): Identifying founders, board members, beneficiaries, controllers
  - Trusts (Form T): Identifying settlors, trustees, protectors, beneficiaries, controllers
  - Life Insurance Wrappers (Form I): Used to declare insured person/premium payer identity

- **Exceptions**: When the bank has no doubt the contracting partner is the BO, for operating entities not holding third-party assets, listed companies, public authorities, regulated financial intermediaries, simple partnerships, condominium collectives, and accounts held by Swiss lawyers/notaries for client matters under professional secrecy.

### Overview of CDB 20 Forms for BO/Controlling Person Identification

| Form | CDB Article Ref. | Purpose | Key Information Required | Applicability Notes |
|------|------------------|---------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| A | Art. 28, 39 | Declare Beneficial Owner(s) of assets / domiciliary company | BO's Full Name, DOB, Nationality, Domicile Address | General form for third-party BOs, required for domiciliary companies |
| K | Art. 20, 21 | Declare Controlling Person(s) of operating legal entities/partnerships | Controlling Person(s) details, basis of control | Used for operating legal entities following cascade approach |
| S | Art. 40 | Declare relevant parties for Foundations | Foundation details, Founder(s), Board Members, Beneficiaries | For foundations and similar asset-holding entities |
| T | Art. 41 | Declare relevant parties for Trusts | Trust details, Settlor(s), Trustee(s), Protector(s), Beneficiaries | For identifying key parties in trust structures |
| I | Art. 42 | Declare Insured Person / Premium Payer for Life Insurance Wrappers | Insured Person / Premium Payer details | Used in specific circumstances for "insurance wrappers" |
| R | Art. 36 | Declaration by Swiss Lawyer/Notary regarding client account | Confirmation of professional secrecy | Allows exemption from BO identification for professional accounts |

### C. Risk-Based Approach and Client Categorization

The Swiss AML framework is fundamentally grounded in a risk-based approach (RBA), requiring financial intermediaries to identify, assess, and understand their ML/TF risks and apply proportionate measures:

**AMLO-FINMA Requirements**:

- **Institutional Risk Analysis (Art. 25)**: Comprehensive analysis of specific ML/TF risks considering client base, products/services, and geographic factors. Must be documented, approved by highest management, and regularly updated.

- **Criteria for Increased Risk (Art. 13)**: Institutions must establish criteria for identifying high-risk relationships, such as:
  - Domicile/nationality in high-risk jurisdictions
  - High-risk business sectors
  - Lack of personal contact during onboarding
  - Complex structures without economic rationale
  - Large asset amounts
  - Frequent high-risk transactions
  - PEP relationships

- **Internal Risk Classification**: Clients must be classified by risk level (minimum standard/high risk), determining the intensity of due diligence and monitoring.

### D. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)

For high-risk relationships and transactions, standard due diligence is insufficient:

**Legal Basis (AMLA Art. 6)**: The duty to clarify economic background and purpose applies particularly to unusual transactions or those with potential criminal origins.

**EDD Triggers (AMLO-FINMA Art. 13, 14)**:
- **High-Risk Relationships**: Foreign PEPs and associates, clients from FATF high-risk countries, foreign correspondent banking relationships, and domestic PEPs with additional risk factors.
- **High-Risk Transactions**: Cash contributions >CHF 100,000, payments involving FATF high-risk countries, and transactions meeting institution-specific risk criteria.

**Specific EDD Measures (AMLO-FINMA Art. 15-19)**:
- **Additional Investigations**: Verify BO identity, establish source of funds/wealth, clarify transaction purpose, assess business activities, determine PEP status.
- **Investigation Methods**: Client information, site visits, public sources, databases, third-party information.
- **Approval Requirements**: Senior management approval for high-risk relationships, Executive Management approval and annual review for PEP relationships.

### EDD Triggers and Required Measures

| Trigger | AMLO-FINMA Reference | Key EDD Measures Required |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Foreign PEP Relationship | Art. 13(3)(a), (b) | Executive Management approval, annual review, source of wealth/funds verification, enhanced monitoring |
| FATF High-Risk Country Client | Art. 13(3)(d) | Senior Management approval, additional investigations, enhanced monitoring |
| Foreign Correspondent Banking | Art. 13(3)(c) | Senior Management approval, investigations, specific correspondent banking due diligence |
| Domestic/Int'l Org PEP with Risk Factors | Art. 13(4)(a)-(c) | Executive Management approval, annual review, source of wealth/funds verification, enhanced monitoring |
| Cash Deposit >CHF 100,000 | Art. 14(3)(a) | Source of funds investigation, documentation |
| High-Risk Country Transaction | Art. 14(3)(b) | Background investigation, enhanced monitoring |
| High-Risk Transaction (by FI criteria) | Art. 14(1) | Background investigation, enhanced monitoring |
| High-Risk Relationship (by FI criteria) | Art. 13(1) | Senior Management approval, investigations, enhanced monitoring |

### E. Ongoing Monitoring and Updating Client Data

AML/CFT due diligence requires continuous vigilance:

**Transaction Monitoring (AMLO-FINMA Art. 20)**: Institutions must implement effective monitoring procedures, with banks and securities firms explicitly required to use IT-based systems. Alerts must be assessed promptly.

**Periodic Review and Data Updating (AMLA Art. 7 para 1bis)**: Financial intermediaries must periodically check and update all client data obtained through due diligence, with frequency and depth determined by risk classification.

**Evolution Toward Dynamic Compliance**: The industry is shifting from static periodic reviews to more dynamic "perpetual KYC" approaches, leveraging technology to continuously monitor data sources in near real-time.

## IV. RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS

Comprehensive record-keeping is fundamental to Swiss AML compliance:

**Legal Basis (AMLA Art. 7)**: Financial intermediaries must maintain records of transactions and all due diligence documentation in a manner allowing competent third parties to form reliable judgments about compliance.

**Accessibility and Assessment**: Records must be organized to facilitate assessment by authorities and allow timely response to information requests or asset seizure orders.

**Retention Period**: All records must be kept for at least ten years after relationship termination or transaction completion.

**Types of Records**:
- Identification documents
- Verification documentation
- Beneficial owner declarations
- BO verification evidence
- EDD investigation records
- Transaction records
- Risk assessments and decisions
- SAR documentation
- Client communications

**Format and Storage**: Records may be physical or digital, but digital systems must ensure data integrity, consistent availability, and readability.

**Data Protection Interaction**: The AMLA's 10-year retention requirement provides legal basis for retaining specific documentation, overriding general data protection principles for these records.

## V. REPORTING OBLIGATIONS AND ASSET FREEZING

### A. Duty to Report Suspicious Activities (SARs) (AMLA Art. 9)

**Mandatory Reporting**: Financial intermediaries must file reports with MROS when they know or have reasonable grounds to suspect assets are linked to:
- Money laundering
- Criminal or terrorist organizations
- Terrorist financing

**Reporting Triggers**:
- Reasonable suspicion regarding assets in existing relationships
- Terminated negotiations due to suspicion
- Information from authorities matching client data

**Definition of "Reasonable Grounds to Suspect" (Art. 9 para 1quater AMLA)**: Requires specific indications that assets might be linked to illicit activities, which cannot be refuted through clarifications under AMLA Art. 6.

### B. Right to Report (SCC Art. 305ter para 2)

Financial intermediaries have the right (not obligation) to report observations merely indicating potential criminal origins of assets, representing a lower threshold than the mandatory reporting duty.

### C. Process for Reporting to MROS

**Platform**: Primary method is through the secure 'goAML' electronic system, requiring registration.

**Content Requirements**:
- Reporting intermediary details
- Identification information for all parties
- Asset details and account balances
- Business relationship information
- Detailed suspicion grounds
- Supporting documentation

**MROS Confirmation**: MROS confirms report receipt, starting the asset freezing period.

### D. MROS Guidance and Typologies

MROS actively guides the financial sector through:
- Annual Reports
- Strategic Analyses
- Timely Alerts
- Typology Reports/Guides
- National Risk Assessments

### E. Asset Freezing (AMLA Art. 10)

**Immediate Freeze**: When filing a mandatory report under AMLA Article 9, intermediaries must immediately freeze connected assets.

**Duration**: The freeze continues until instructions from prosecution authorities or automatically lapses after five working days from MROS confirmation.

**Relationship Termination**: If no feedback is received within 40 days, the intermediary may terminate the business relationship.

### F. Consequences and Protections

**Penalty for Non-Compliance**: Failure to file mandatory SARs can result in fines up to CHF 500,000, with potential personal liability for officers.

**Legal Protection ("Safe Harbour")**: Intermediaries acting with due diligence are protected from liability for breach of secrecy or contract when filing reports and freezing assets.

## VI. ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES

Beyond specific due diligence duties, Swiss AML legislation mandates robust internal measures:

**General Requirement (AMLA Art. 8)**: Financial intermediaries must implement necessary organizational measures to prevent ML/TF, including staff training and internal controls.

**Specific Requirements (AMLO-FINMA Art. 24-27)**:

- **AML Compliance Function**: Designated qualified individuals or dedicated unit serving as competence center for:
  - Management support and advice
  - Policy development
  - Training program implementation
  - Compliance supervision
  - Transaction monitoring oversight
  - Reporting to management

- **Internal Directives**: Written policies covering all AML/CFT aspects, including:
  - High-risk criteria
  - Monitoring principles
  - Management involvement procedures
  - Training policies
  - PEP handling
  - SAR filing responsibilities
  - EDD procedures
  - Internal thresholds
  - Role allocations

- **Staff Integrity and Training**: Careful personnel selection and periodic role-specific training.

- **Global Monitoring**: International operations must implement group-wide standards and consolidated risk management.

- **Audit and Control**: Regular independent review of compliance measures by external or internal audit functions.

## VII. TECHNOLOGY IN AML COMPLIANCE

While only certain technological applications are mandated by regulations, advanced technologies offer solutions to growing compliance challenges:

**Potential Applications**:

- **Enhanced Efficiency**: NLP and RAG technologies can automate document review, data extraction, summarization, and report generation.

- **Improved Risk Detection**: AI-powered tools and Knowledge Graphs can integrate diverse data sources, map complex relationships, uncover hidden risks, detect fraud patterns, and enhance transaction monitoring context.

- **Regulatory Management**: NLP tools can monitor regulatory changes and compare against internal policies, while supporting the shift toward perpetual KYC models.

**Considerations**: Implementation requires careful planning, data preparation, model customization, system integration, testing, and attention to data security, privacy, and explainability standards.

## VIII. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

The Swiss Anti-Money Laundering framework represents a comprehensive and evolving system protecting the integrity of one of the world's leading financial centers, built on:

- Robust legal and regulatory foundation
- Multi-layered supervision
- Stringent due diligence obligations
- Mandatory reporting and asset freezing
- Strong internal controls

Looking ahead, several developments will shape the Swiss AML landscape:

- **Increased Transparency**: The planned Federal Act on Transparency of Legal Entities (TLEA) will create a central beneficial owner register.

- **CDB Revision**: Expected after TLEA implementation (2027 or later) to refine practical due diligence standards.

- **High-Risk Focus Areas**: Continued regulatory scrutiny on PEPs, complex structures, cross-border transactions, and virtual assets.

- **Technology Evolution**: Increasing adoption of AI, NLP, Knowledge Graphs, and RAG to enhance efficiency, improve risk detection, and support dynamic monitoring.

Navigating the Swiss AML environment requires deep understanding of legal requirements, regulatory expectations, and industry best practices, with investment in robust compliance programs, risk management frameworks, continuous training, and potentially advanced technological tools.
