TITLE: Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) - Compliance Implementation Guide

1. SCOPE AND APPLICATION

The Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) applies to financial intermediaries and sets forth obligations for preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, and ensuring proper due diligence in financial transactions.

Financial intermediaries subject to AMLA include:
- Banks and securities dealers
- Fund management companies
- Asset managers
- Insurance institutions
- Payment service providers
- Loan, leasing, and factoring providers
- Currency exchange services
- Trustees and fiduciaries
- Commodity and precious metal traders (when exceeding thresholds)

2. KEY COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS

2.1 Customer Identification (KYC)
- Verify identity of natural persons using valid government-issued ID
- Verify legal entities through commercial register extracts
- Document verification process with date, signature, and copies of identification documents
- For remote onboarding, follow FINMA Circular 2016/7 requirements

EXAMPLE:
When onboarding a corporate client, obtain:
- Commercial register extract (less than 12 months old)
- Articles of association or equivalent
- Verification of authorized signatories
- Documentation of business activities and purpose

2.2 Beneficial Ownership Verification
- Identify and verify natural persons who ultimately own or control the relationship
- Document the verification process with appropriate forms
- Repeat verification when circumstances change

EXAMPLE:
For a holding company structure:
- Document full ownership chain up to natural persons
- Identify all individuals owning/controlling 25% or more
- If no individual meets 25% threshold, identify senior managing officials
- Maintain a visual diagram of complex structures

2.3 Risk-Based Approach
- Categorize clients based on risk (low, medium, high)
- Apply enhanced measures for high-risk relationships
- Document risk assessment methodology and decisions

EXAMPLE:
Risk assessment factors include:
- Client jurisdiction (FATF high-risk vs. low-risk countries)
- Business activity (cash-intensive, high-value goods)
- Complexity of structures (multiple layers, offshore entities)
- Transaction patterns (volume, frequency, cross-border)
- PEP status or connections

2.4 Transaction Monitoring
- Implement system to detect unusual transactions
- Document review of alerts and investigations
- Maintain audit trail of monitoring activities

EXAMPLE:
Transactions requiring investigation include:
- Unexplained wire transfers to/from high-risk jurisdictions
- Cash transactions near reporting thresholds
- Roundtrip transactions (funds going out and returning)
- Activity inconsistent with client profile or business purpose
- Transactions with no apparent economic rationale

2.5 Suspicious Activity Reporting
- Report founded suspicions to MROS via goAML system
- Maintain transaction freeze during investigation period
- Observe non-disclosure requirements

EXAMPLE:
Reporting process steps:
1. Employee detects unusual activity and escalates
2. Compliance officer investigates and documents findings
3. If suspicion cannot be dispelled, prepare SAR
4. Submit via goAML within legal timeframe
5. Maintain confidentiality about the report
6. Implement asset freeze if required

3. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Record Keeping
- Maintain all customer due diligence records for 10 years
- Ensure records are readily accessible for audits
- Document compliance decisions and rationale

EXAMPLE:
Required documentation includes:
- Client identification documents
- Beneficial ownership forms
- Transaction records
- Compliance approvals and decisions
- Risk assessments and reviews
- Suspicious activity investigations

4. ORGANIZATION AND CONTROLS

4.1 Internal Controls
- Establish independent compliance function
- Implement multi-level control system
- Conduct regular compliance reviews

EXAMPLE:
Three-lines-of-defense model:
1. First line: Front office verifies client identity and flags unusual activities
2. Second line: Compliance reviews documentation and investigates alerts
3. Third line: Internal audit conducts independent testing

4.2 Training
- Provide regular AML training to all relevant staff
- Document training attendance and effectiveness
- Update training as regulations evolve

EXAMPLE:
Training program components:
- Initial onboarding training for new employees
- Annual refresher courses
- Role-specific modules (e.g., client-facing, compliance)
- Case study exercises
- Testing of knowledge and procedures
