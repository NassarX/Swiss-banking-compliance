TITLE: MROS Suspicious Activity Reporting Requirements - Compliance Implementation Guide

1. INTRODUCTION TO MROS

The Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland (MROS) is Switzerland's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) responsible for:
- Receiving and analyzing suspicious activity reports (SARs)
- Forwarding relevant cases to law enforcement authorities
- Exchanging information with foreign FIUs
- Publishing typologies and statistics on money laundering

2. REPORTING OBLIGATIONS

2.1 Legal Basis for Reporting
- Mandatory reporting under Art. 9 AMLA
- Right to report under Art. 305ter SCC
- Non-disclosure requirements during reporting

EXAMPLE:
Mandatory reporting triggers include:
- Knowledge or reasonable suspicion that assets involve criminal origins
- Assets controlled by criminal organization
- Assets connected to terrorist financing
- Unusual transaction patterns that cannot be clarified
- Client matching terrorist or sanctions list

2.2 Reasonable Suspicion Standard
- Facts-based assessment
- Beyond mere possibility but less than certainty
- Cannot be dispelled by clarifications
- Document basis for suspicion

EXAMPLE:
Suspicious circumstances requiring reporting:
- Transactions inconsistent with client profile
- Unexplained use of complex structures
- Transactions with high-risk jurisdictions without clear rationale
- Adverse media about client indicating criminal activity
- Client reluctance to provide standard information

3. REPORTING PROCESS

3.1 goAML Reporting System
- Mandatory electronic submission via goAML
- Registration requirements for financial intermediaries
- Secure information transmission

EXAMPLE:
goAML reporting workflow:
1. Register organization and users in goAML portal
2. Login to secure portal for report submission
3. Complete web forms with required information
4. Upload supporting documentation
5. Submit report with digital signature
6. Maintain record of submission with reference number

3.2 Information Requirements
- Detailed client information
- Transaction data (up to 100 transactions)
- Reason for suspicion
- Supporting documentation

EXAMPLE:
Required SAR information includes:

- Transaction details (dates, amounts, counterparties)
- Basis for suspicion (detailed narrative)
- Supporting documentation (account statements, contracts, correspondence)
- Financial intermediary contact information

3.3 Asset Freezing Requirements
- When freezing is required vs. optional
- Duration of freeze

3. If forwarded to prosecution, maintain freeze for 5 additional days
4. Lift freeze only if explicitly instructed or timeframe expires
5. Do not inform client about reporting or freezing reason

4. POST-REPORTING OBLIGATIONS

4.1 Confidentiality Requirements

- Provide generic explanation for transaction delays
- Use secure channels for MROS communications
- Train staff on non-disclosure obligations

4.2 Ongoing Monitoring
- Continued relationship monitoring if maintained
- Additional reporting requirements
